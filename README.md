# Transaction-Packet-Parser Plugin
Plugin for translating the transaction packet. Made by SacriPudding (Discord: SacriPudding#1281).

**NOTE:** This plugin is nothing by itself, it just translates the packet for you to use in your own projects.

# How To Use
You can install this plugin with `npm i @bdsx/transaction-packet-parser`. You can also use the built in plugin manager for BDSx.

If you wish to use my scripts inside of your own plugin (i.e, the NBT reader or packet buffer script) you can find them at the project's GitHub page [here](https://github.com/sacripudding/transaction-packet-parser/).

# Documentation
You can find the documentation for the different functions and classes [here](https://sacripudding.github.io/transaction-packet-parser/).

Source code for the scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/sacripudding/transaction-packet-parser/).

# Credits

The packet translation was pulled partially from the PMMP documentation and you can find the inventory packet [here](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/stable/src/pocketmine/network/mcpe/protocol/InventoryTransactionPacket.php).
